Cyber Security Breaches

Linkedin  had information for over 700 Million users earlier this year
it sounds like the hacker used linkedins api to access data. All I could find
is that the hacker used data scraping techniques to acquire all of these users 
information from the api and then posted the information on the dark web, and
sold much of the information as well. Linkedin claimed at first that no private 
information was exposed but later the hacker posted information that contained 
a lot of private info. It sounds like Linkedin is still in the process of fixing this issue
and most likely making big changes within their api.
